    "text": "The MPIReco project is a package written in the programming language Julia. In order to install MPIReco you first have to install Julia in version 0.7 (version 1.0 not yet supported). Then open Julia and enter ] to open the package mode. Then enterdev https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIFiles.jl.git\ndev https://github.com/tknopp/RegularizedLeastSquares.jl.git\ndev https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIReco.jl.gitwhich will install the package including its dependencies MPIFiles and RegularizedLeastSquares. Then enterusing MPIRecoto load the packageIn order to obtain the example datasets you have to execute the unit tests which can be done by enteringtest MPIRecowithin the package mode of Julia."

    "text": "We will start looking at a very basic reconstruction scriptusing MPIReco\n\nfSF = MPIFile(\"SF_MP\")\nf = MPIFile(\"dataMP01\")\n\nc = reconstruction(fSF, f;\n                   SNRThresh=5,\n                   frames=1:10,\n                   minFreq=80e3,\n                   recChannels=1:2,\n                   iterations=1,\n                   spectralLeakageCorrection=true)\nLets go through that script step by step. First, we create handles for the system matrix and the measurement data. Both are of the type MPIFile which is an abstract type that can for instance be an MDFFile or a BrukerFile.Using the handles to the MPI datasets we can call the reconstruction function that has various variants depending on the types that are passed to it. Here, we exploit the multiple dispatch mechanism of julia. In addition to the file handles we also apply several reconstruction parameters using keyword arguments. In this case, we set the SNR threshold to 5 implying that only matrix rows with an SNR above 5 are used during reconstruction. The parameter frame decides which frame of the measured data should be reconstructed.The object c is of type ImageMeta and contains not only the reconstructed data but also several metadata such as the reconstruction parameters being used. c has in total 5 dimensions. The first dimension encodes multi-spectral channels. Dimensions 2-4 encode the three spatial dimensions. The last dimension contains the number of frames being stored in c."
