# MPI Reco

Julia package for reconstruction of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) data

## Introduction

This project provides functions for the reconstruction of MPI data. The project
is implemented in the programming language Julia and contains algorithms for

* regular 1D / 2D / 3D image reconstruction using a system matrix based approach
* multi-patch and multi-gradient reconstruction for data the has been acquired
  using a focus field sequence
* multi-colored image reconstruction
* matrix-compression techniques

Key features are

* frequency filtering for memory efficient reconstruction. Only frequencies used
  during reconstructions are loaded into memory.
* spectral leakage correction (implemented in MPIFiles.jl)
