# MPI Reco

Initiative for open magnetic particle imaging data

## Introduction

Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging technique that allows
to determine the spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The aim
of this project is to provide MPI data that are freely available for the research
community. To facilitate reproducible research all available
information including a detailed description of the used phantoms and the applied
measurement sequences are provided.

All MPI data is stored in the [MPI Data Format (MDF)](https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MDF).
The MDF provides a common data format for the storage of MPI raw data, calibration data,
and reconstruction data.

This projects comes with a first set of datasets covering the most interesting
cases to get started with MPI. New datasets can be easily added and researcher worldwide
are invited to contribute own datasets.
