# MPIReco.jl

*Julia package for the reconstruction of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) data*

## Introduction

This project provides functions for the reconstruction of MPI data. The project
is implemented in the programming language Julia and contains algorithms for

* [Basic Reconstruction](@ref) using a system matrix based approach
* [Multi-Patch Reconstruction](@ref) for data that has been acquired
  using a focus field sequence
* [Multi-Contrast Reconstruction](@ref)
* [Matrix-Compression Techniques](@ref)

Key features are

* Frequency filtering for memory efficient reconstruction. Only frequencies used
  during reconstructions are loaded into memory.
* Different solvers provided by the package [RegularizedLeastSquares.jl](https://github.com/tknopp/RegularizedLeastSquares.jl)
* High-level until low-level reconstruction providing maximum flexibility for
  the user
* Spectral leakage correction (implemented in
  [MPIFiles.jl](https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIFiles.jl))

## Installation

Start julia and open the package mode by entering `]`. Then enter
```julia
add MPIReco
```
This will install the packages `MPIReco.jl` and all its dependencies. In particular
this will install the core dependencies [MPIFiles](https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIFiles.jl.git) and [RegularizedLeastSquares](https://github.com/tknopp/RegularizedLeastSquares.jl.git).
