    "category": "section",
    "text": "We will start looking at a very basic reconstruction scriptusing MPIReco\n\nfSF = MPIFile(\"SF_MP\")\nf = MPIFile(\"dataMP01\")\n\nc = reconstruction(fSF, f;\n                   SNRThresh=5,\n                   frames=1:10,\n                   minFreq=80e3,\n                   recChannels=1:2,\n                   iterations=1,\n                   spectralLeakageCorrection=true)\nLets go through that script step by step. First, we create handles for the system matrix and the measurement data. Both are of the type MPIFile which is an abstract type that can for instance be an MDFFile or a BrukerFile.Using the handles to the MPI datasets we can call the reconstruction function that has various variants depending on the types that are passed to it. Here, we exploit the multiple dispatch mechanism of julia. In addition to the file handles we also apply several reconstruction parameters using keyword arguments. In this case, we set the SNR threshold to 5 implying that only matrix rows with an SNR above 5 are used during reconstruction. The parameter frame decides which frame of the measured data should be reconstructed.The object c is of type ImageMeta and contains not only the reconstructed data but also several metadata such as the reconstruction parameters being used. More details on the return type are discussed in the Reconstruction Results"

The function signature is given byfunction reconstruction(d::MDFDatasetStore, study::Study,\n                        exp::Experiment, recoParams::Dict)This reconstruction is also called an on disk reconstruction because it assumes that one has a data store (i.e. a structured folder of files) where the file location is uniquely determined by the study name and experiment number. All reconstruction parameters are passed to this method by the recoParams dictionary. On disk reconstruction has the advantage that the routine will perform reconstruction only once for a particular set of parameters. If that parameter set has already been reconstructed, the data will loaded from disk. However, the on disk reconstruction needs some experience with dataset stores to set it up correctly and is not suited for unstructured data."

An overview how this dictionary looks like is given in the section Parameters.The above reconstruction method basically does two thingsPull out the location of measurement data and system matrix from the recoParams dictionary.\nPass all parameter to the low level reconstruction method in the form of keyword parameters.In turn the next level reconstruction looks like thisfunction reconstruction(bSF::Union{T,Vector{T}}, bMeas::MPIFile; kargs...)There are, however also some reconstruction methods in-between that look like thisfunction reconstruction(filenameSF::AbstractString, filenameMeas::AbstractString; kargs...)\nfunction reconstruction(filenameMeas::AbstractString; kargs...)In both cases, an MPIFile is created based on the input filename. The second version also guesses the system matrix based on what is stored within the measurement file. This usually only works, if this is executed on a system where the files are stored at exactly the same location as how they have been measured."
