First, we create handles for the system matrix and the measurement data. Both are of the type MPIFile which is an abstract type that can for instance be an MDFFile or a BrukerFile.Using the handles to the MPI datasets we can call the reconstruction function that has various variants depending on the types that are passed to it. Here, we exploit the multiple dispatch mechanism of julia. In addition to the file handles we also apply several reconstruction parameters using keyword arguments. In this case, we set the SNR threshold to 5 implying that only matrix rows with an SNR above 5 are used during reconstruction. The parameter frame decides which frame of the measured data should be reconstructed.The object c is of type ImageMeta and contains not only the reconstructed data but also several metadata such as the reconstruction parameters being used. More details on the return type are discussed in the Reconstruction Results"

The function signature is given byfunction reconstruction(d::MDFDatasetStore, study::Study,\n                        exp::Experiment, recoParams::Dict)This reconstruction is also called an on disk reconstruction because it assumes that one has a data store (i.e. a structured folder of files) where the file location is uniquely determined by the study name and experiment number. All reconstruction parameters are passed to this method by the recoParams dictionary. On disk reconstruction has the advantage that the routine will perform reconstruction only once for a particular set of parameters. If that parameter set has already been reconstructed, the data will loaded from disk. However, the on disk reconstruction needs some experience with dataset stores to set it up correctly and is not suited for unstructured data."

The second version also guesses the system matrix based on what is stored within the measurement file. This usually only works, if this is executed on a system where the files are stored at exactly the same location as how they have been measured."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "The middle level reconstruction first checks, whether the dataset is a multi-patch or a single-patch file. Then it will call either reconstructionSinglePatch or reconstructionMultiPatch. Both have essentially the signaturefunction reconstructionSinglePatch(bSF::Union{T,Vector{T}}, bMeas::MPIFile;\n                                  minFreq=0, maxFreq=1.25e6, SNRThresh=-1,\n                                  maxMixingOrder=-1, numUsedFreqs=-1, sortBySNR=false, recChannels=1:numReceivers(bMeas),\n                                  bEmpty = nothing, bgFrames = 1, fgFrames = 1,\n                                  varMeanThresh = 0, minAmplification=2, kargs...) where {T<:MPIFile}Here, one can see various parameters that can be used to control, which frequency components are being used for reconstruction. All these parameters are passed to the filterFrequencies function from MPIFiles.jl.The function reconstructionSinglePatch performs the frequency filtering and then callsfunction reconstruction(bSF::Union{T,Vector{T}}, bMeas::MPIFile, freq::Array;\n  bEmpty = nothing, bgFrames = 1,  denoiseWeight = 0, redFactor = 0.0, thresh = nothing,\n  loadasreal = false, solver = \"kaczmarz\", sparseTrafo = nothing, saveTrafo=false,\n  gridsize = gridSizeCommon(bSF), fov=calibFov(bSF), center=[0.0,0.0,0.0], useDFFoV=false,\n  deadPixels=Int[], bgCorrectionInternal=false, kargs...) where {T<:MPIFile}One can see that the frequency index is passed to this function as the third argument. All new keyword arguments are essentially used for determining the way how the system matrix is loaded. For instance with the parameters gridsize, fov, center it is possible to change the grid at which the system function is being loaded.Once the system matrix is loaded, the next lower level function is called:function reconstruction(S, bSF::Union{T,Vector{T}}, bMeas::MPIFile, freq::Array, grid;\n  frames = nothing, bEmpty = nothing, bgFrames = 1, nAverages = 1, numAverages=nAverages,\n  sparseTrafo = nothing, loadasreal = false, maxload = 100, maskDFFOV=false,\n  weightType=WeightingType.None, weightingLimit = 0, solver = \"kaczmarz\",\n  spectralCleaning=true, fgFrames=1:10, bgCorrectionInternal=false,\n  noiseFreqThresh=0.0, kargs...) where {T<:MPIFile}This function is responsible for loading the measurement data and potential background data that is subtracted from the measurements. For any frame to be reconstructed, the low level reconstruction routine is called."

For a regular reconstruction one will basically feed in an Array{ComplexF32,2} in here, although more precisely it will be a Transposed version of that type if the Kaczmarz algorithm is being used for efficiency reasons.However, in case that matrix compression is applied S will be of type SparseMatrixCSC. And for Multi-Patch Reconstruction S will be of type FFOperator. Hence, the solvers are implemented in a very generic way and require only certain functions to be implemented. The low level reconstruction method calls one of the solvers from RegularizedLeastSquares.jl."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "For multi-patch reconstruction the method proposed by Szwargulski et al. is implemented in MPIReco. It is generalized however.We first discuss the measurements for the multi-patch case. On modern MPI scanners the BrukerFile or MDFFile can be used as is. However, the data that we use in our unit tests consists of several single-patch measurements. to combine these measurements we callb = MultiMPIFile([\"dataMP01\", \"dataMP02\", \"dataMP03\", \"dataMP04\"])b now can be uses as if were a multi-patch file.Now we get to the system matrix. The most simple approach is to use a single system matrix that was measured at the center. This can be done usingbSF = MultiMPIFile([\"SF_MP\"])\n\nc = reconstruction(bSF, b; SNRThresh=5, frames=1, minFreq=80e3,\n                   recChannels=1:2, iterations=1, spectralLeakageCorrection=false)The reconstruction parameters are not special here but are the same as discussed in the Parameters section.It is also possible to use multiple system matrices, which is currently the best way to take field imperfection into account. Our test data has four patches and we therefore can usebSF = MultiMPIFile([\"SF_MP01\", \"SF_MP02\", \"SF_MP03\", \"SF_MP04\"])\n\nc = reconstruction(bSF, b; SNRThresh=5, frames=1, minFreq=80e3,\n                   recChannels=1:2, iterations=1, spectralLeakageCorrection=false)Now we want somewhat more flexibility anddefine a mapping between the system matrix and the patches, here we allow to use the same system matrix for multiple patches\nmake it possible to change the FFP position. Usually the value stored in the file is not 100% correct due to field imperfections.\nwe might also want to preload the system matricesAll those thing can be done as is shown in the following examplebSFs = MultiMPIFile([\"SF_MP01\", \"SF_MP02\", \"SF_MP03\", \"SF_MP04\"])\nmapping = [1,2,3,4]\nfreq = filterFrequencies(bSFs, SNRThresh=5, minFreq=80e3)\nS = [getSF(SF,freq,nothing,\"kaczmarz\", bgcorrection=false)[1] for SF in bSFs]\nSFGridCenter = zeros(3,4)\nFFPos = zeros(3,4)\nFFPos[:,1] = [-0.008, 0.008, 0.0]\nFFPos[:,2] = [-0.008, -0.008, 0.0]\nFFPos[:,3] = [0.008, 0.008, 0.0]\nFFPos[:,4] = [0.008, -0.008, 0.0]\nc4 = reconstruction(bSFs, b; SNRThresh=5, frames=1, minFreq=80e3,\n        recChannels=1:2,iterations=1, spectralLeakageCorrection=false,\n        mapping=mapping, systemMatrices = S, SFGridCenter=SFGridCenter,\n        FFPos=FFPos, FFPosSF=FFPos)"
