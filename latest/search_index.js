    "text": "The MPIReco project is a package written in the programming language Julia. In order to install MPIReco you first have to install Julia in version 0.6. Then open Julia and enterPkg.clone(\"https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIReco.jl.git\")which will install the package. Then enterusing MPIRecowhich will install the dependencies MPIFiles and LinearSolver. Further dependencies have already been installed during the clone of the package.In order to obtain the example datasets you have to execute the unit tests which can be done by enteringPkg.test(\"MPIReco\")"
