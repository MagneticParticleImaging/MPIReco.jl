The project is implemented in the programming language Julia and contains algorithms forregular 1D / 2D / 3D image reconstruction using a system matrix based approach\nmulti-patch and multi-gradient reconstruction for data the has been acquired using a focus field sequence\nmulti-colored image reconstruction\nmatrix-compression techniquesKey features arefrequency filtering for memory efficient reconstruction. Only frequencies used during reconstructions are loaded into memory.\nspectral leakage correction (implemented in MPIFiles.jl)"

    "text": "The MPIReco project is a package written in the programming language Julia. In order to install MPIReco you first have to install Julia in version 0.6. Then open Julia and enterPkg.clone(\"https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIReco.jl.git\")which will install the package. Then enterusing MPIRecowhich will install the dependencies MPIFiles and LinearSolver. Further dependencies have already been installed during the clone of the package.In order to obtain the example datasets you have to execute the unit tests which can be done by enteringPkg.test(\"MPIReco\")"

First, we create handles for the system matrix and the measurement data. Both are of the type MPIFile which is an abstract type that can for instance be an MDFFile or a BrukerFile.Using the handles to the MPI datasets we can call the reconstruction function that has various variants depending on the t"
