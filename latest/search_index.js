    "text": "Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging technique that allows to determine the spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The aim of this project is to provide MPI data that are freely available for the research community. To facilitate reproducible research all available information including a detailed description of the used phantoms and the applied measurement sequences are provided.All MPI data is stored in the MPI Data Format (MDF). The MDF provides a common data format for the storage of MPI raw data, calibration data, and reconstruction data.This projects comes with a first set of datasets covering the most interesting cases to get started with MPI. New datasets can be easily added and researcher worldwide are invited to contribute own datasets."

    "text": "The MPIReco project is a package written in the programming language Julia. In order to install MPIReco you first have to install Julia in version 0.6. Then open Julia and enterPkg.clone(\"https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIReco.jl.git\")which will install the package. Then enterusing MPIRecowhich will install the dependencies MPIFiles and LinearSolver. Further dependencies have already been installed during the clone of the package.In order to obtain the example datasets you have to execute the unit tests which can be done by enteringPkg.test(\"MPIReco\")"
